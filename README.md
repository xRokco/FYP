# FYP
HTML5 image editing with the canvas element

## Installation
Put the entire project on a webserver and visit index.html in a modern web browser (Chrome works best)

For testing purposes, you can use the simple Python HTTP server to serve the files -

On Linux, cd to the project directory and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and then visit `localhost:8000` in your web browser.

On windows do the same but run `python -m http.server` and then go to `localhost:8000`

Otherwise just put it in a web server like Apache

## My code
Everything in the project was written by me, except the following libraries
* farbtastic.js - for the colour wheel - https://github.com/mattfarina/farbtastic
* fabric.js - the main canvas library - http://fabricjs.com/
* skeleton.css - the main CSS file - http://getskeleton.com/
* normalize.css - another Skeleton CSS file
